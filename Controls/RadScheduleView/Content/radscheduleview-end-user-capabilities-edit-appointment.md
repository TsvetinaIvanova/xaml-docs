# Using code

You can edit an appointment using the code. Here are the steps to accomplish this:
            Call __BeginEdit()__ method of the __RadScheduleView__ control. It returns whether or not  the appointment or the occurrence can be edited. This method has 3 overloads:
          __BeginEdit()__ - the current appointment is editing.
            __BeginEdit( IAppointment__ appointment ) - the passed appointment is editing.
            __BeginEdit( Occurrence__ occurrence ) - the passed occurrence is editing.
            
            If __BeginEdit()__ returns __True__ - edit the appointment or the occurrence.
          
            Call __Commit()__ method to commit the changes and to update the __UI__.
          

```C#


if (this.radScheduleView.BeginEdit(appointment))
{
    appointment.Subject = "New Subject";
    this.radScheduleView.Commit();
}

```



```VB.NET


If Me.radScheduleView.BeginEdit(appointment) Then
 appointment.Subject = "New Subject"
 Me.radScheduleView.Commit()
End If

```
