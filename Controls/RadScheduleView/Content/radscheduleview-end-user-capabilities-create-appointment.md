        This topic describes the work flow for creating an appointment in __RadScheduleView__ control.
      

# Using UI

__RadScheduleView__ uses one and the same dialog to create and edit appointments. This topic describes the end-user's work flow for creating a new appointment.
        In order to create a new appointment just double click the time when you want the appointment to occur. In Day, Week or Timeline view, you can double-click on a specific starting time to create an appointment. In Month view, appointments always start out as all-day events. The edit appointment dialog appears:


              Â 
            ![RadScheduleView Create Appointment](../Media\radscheduleview_end_user_capabilities_create_appointment_01.png)Enter Subject, Description, Start and End time of the appointment. Keep in mind that the subject text will be displayed as label for this appointment in the schedule view.You can also assign a category, time marker or importance by using the tool bar controls.
            If you have completed the appointment edit, click the 'OK' button or press the __Enter__ key. If you want to cancel the appointment creation, click the X button, the Close button or press the __Esc__ key.
          

# Using code

You can add new appointment using the code. Here are the steps to accomplish this:
            Call__ CreateNew()__ method of the __RadScheduleView__ control. It creates an instance of the __IAppointment__ class and returns it. This method has 2 overloads:
          __CreateNew()__ - initialize a new __IAppointment__ instance.
            __CreateNew__(__IAppointment__ appointment) - the given appointment is used to initialize new __IAppointment__ instance.
            Set the properties for the new appointment.
            Call __Commit()__ method to commit the changes to this object and to update the __UI__.
          
IAppointment appointment = this.radScheduleView.CreateNew();
appointment.Start = DateTime.Now;
appointment.End = DateTime.Now.AddHours(1);
appointment.Subject = "New appointment";
this.radScheduleView.Commit();
Dim appointment As IAppointment = Me.radScheduleView.CreateNew()
appointment.Start = DateTime.Now
appointment.End = DateTime.Now.AddHours(1)
appointment.Subject = "New appointment"
Me.radScheduleView.Commit()
