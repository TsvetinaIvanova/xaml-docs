# Prerequisites

The walkthrough in this section is intended for users who are familiar with developing applications for SilverlightWPF by using Visual Studio and know how to work with Telerik RadControls for SilverlightWPF. You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:

* Visual Studio 2010

* ADO.NET Entity Framework 4.1http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=26825

* RIA Services for Visual Studio 2010http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28357



With the current version __(v1.0 SP2)__ WCF RIA Services __doesnâ€™t support Many-To-Many__  relationships between the Entities, but we have such ones in the Database. To work around this limitation, we use an additional property which forces EF to create 
Many-To-Many table.
      	

Prior knowledge of the following concepts is also helpful, but not required to complete the walkthrough:

* WCF RIA Serviceshttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee707344%28v=VS.91%29.aspx

* Entity Data Models and the ADO.NET Entity Framework. For more information, see
