A very common scenario when using RadScheduleView is the usage of custom appointments. When you create a **Custom Appointment** class you gain the ability to append additional properties to the base Appointment class, to add them to your custom AppointmentItem and optionally to its ToolTip, display them in the EditAppointment dialog while supporting the cancelation of editing. 

In this article we will explore the process of using custom appointments in RadScheduleView. We will go through the following steps:


[Create a custom appointment class and populate the RadScheduleView control with custom appointments](#Creating-a-Custom-Appointment-class)
[Modify the EditAppointment dialog to display the custom data of the newly created custom appointment class](#Creating-a-Custom-Appointment-dialog)
[Customize the AppointmentItem and its ToolTip to display the new data](#Changing-the-Style-of-the-AppointmentItem)
